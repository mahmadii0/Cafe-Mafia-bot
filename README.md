# Cafe Mafia

This project is a Telegram bot for the Mafia game, based on the Iranian scenario. It is my first project, developed using Python! Below, I'll highlight a few points about the project. If you have any suggestions for improvements, I'd be happy to hear them!

## Key Points
1. The strings in this project are in **English**.  
   (when you use a persian text command, the language of game will change to **Persian**)
   
3. I haven't used `async/await` since it wasn't necessary for this projectâ€”and it works perfectly fine! ðŸ˜‚

5. The constants.py file, need to change for database conncetion detail and bot token

## Game Scenario
Godfather 3 is a social deduction hidden-role game based on reasoning and inference. In this game, players are divided into three groups: the majority citizens, the mafia team, and a single independent role.

The roles are secret, known only to their owners and the moderator. The goal of the citizens is to take control of the city and eliminate the mafia, while the mafia wins if they equal the number of citizensâ€”except for Jack, who has different conditions.

The game consists of alternating night and day phases.

### Game Roles

#### Saul Goodman
- **Abilities**:  
  - Can trade and buy instead of shooting at night.  
  - Can turn a simple citizen into a mafia member once.

#### Matador
- **Abilities**:  
  - Wakes up with the mafia team at night.  
  - Can remove a player's night ability by targeting them.

  - Can save himself once during the game.  
  - Unlimited ability to save others.

  - If he mistakenly shoots a citizen, he dies and cannot be saved by the doctor.  
  - Has a vest that protects him from one shot.  

#### Citizen Kane
(In codes, i wrote Kein)

  - Can reveal a player's identity on one chosen night.  
  - If he identifies a mafia member correctly, the moderator reveals it to the crowd the next morning.

4. **Citizen Special Roles**:

   - On the **night of slaughter**, itâ€™s recommended to inquire about the next dayâ€™s situation.
